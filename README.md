Title: Student Information System
Description: The Student Information System is a JavaFX-based application that helps manage student records,
courses, and their enrollments. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete information about students and courses.
The system makes it easy to register students for courses and view their details through a user-friendly interface.
It uses a database to store data and follows a clear structure, ensuring efficient and organized management of academic information.
