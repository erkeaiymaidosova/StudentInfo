# Title: Student Information System
## Description: The Student Information System is a JavaFX-based application that helps manage student records,
courses, and their enrollments. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete information about students and courses.
The system makes it easy to register students for courses and view their details through a user-friendly interface.
It uses a database to store data and follows a clear structure, ensuring efficient and organized management of academic information.

## List of 10 key functionalities essential for the completion of the Student Information System project:

1.Add New Student Records
- Allow users to add new students with details such as ID, name, department, and total credits.
2.View Student Records
- Display a list of all students in a table view, with options to filter and search by criteria such as ID or name.
3.Update Student Records
- Enable editing and updating of existing student information.
4.Delete Student Records
- Allow users to remove student records from the system.
5.Add, View, Update, and Delete Courses
- Manage course information, including course ID, title, department, and credits.
6.Manage Student Course Enrollments
- Facilitate adding, updating, and removing course enrollments for students using the Takes table.
7.Search Functionality
- Implement search features to locate specific student or course records by different criteria, such as name, ID, or course title.
8.Database Connectivity and CRUD Operations
- Connect to a database to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on Student, Course, and Takes tables.
9.Graphical User Interface (GUI) for User Interaction
- Create a user-friendly GUI using JavaFX to interact with the application, including buttons, forms, and table views.
10.Input Validation and Exception Handling
- Ensure that data entered by users is valid and handle errors or exceptions gracefully, providing informative messages when necessary.

## Roles of our members:
- Mairam:Responsible for creating the user interface using JavaFX and SceneBuilder with presentation ans documantation
- Cholpon and Erkeaiym:Work together to develop the application's core functionality and connect it to the database.
